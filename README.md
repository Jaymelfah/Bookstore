# Bookstore
In this project I lay the foundations for a Bookstore website. I created the React part of the app and set up routing using React Router. I configured the Redux Store and wrote actions and reducers for adding and removing books. I linked React and Redux and 
implemented add books and remove books functionalities. I connected the bookstore to the Bookstore API and made the add and remove actions functional.
